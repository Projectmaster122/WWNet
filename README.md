# WWNet
A C# WinForms web engine / browser / whatever you wanna call it, running my own versions of HTML, CSS and JS - WHTML, WCSS and embedded C#; W stands for worse, and C# because everyone hates JS<br />
Idea stolen from https://youtu.be/qiOtinFFfk8<br />
Documentation for the 3 languages coming soon<br />
Also Feather is the renderer / parser's name bc my friend suggested Wurst (a Minecraft client) so I said Feather lol<br />
And it's called WWNet bc I wanted to call it WWeb (worse web) but my brain died
